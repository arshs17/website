                    One of my favorite ways to explore Boston is through food, Iâ€™m a huge fan of using Beli to track restaurants Iâ€™ve tried and discover new spots around the city. Whether itâ€™s enjoying tacos at Lolita or Mediterranean flavors at Krasi, I love finding the best eats and sharing them with friends.
